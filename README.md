# Project 1

### Always remember to : 
 * use clear indentation, spacing => for additional readability 
 * include comments to describe what the code does 
 * NO redundant code. (No empty div, no redundant css properties...) 

### CSS : 
 * try to use shared class as much as possible 
 * try to stay away from using `id`
 * Mobile First approach
