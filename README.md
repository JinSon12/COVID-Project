# Project 1

### Always remember to : 
 * use clear indentation, spacing => for additional readability 
 * include comments to describe what the code does 
 * NO redundant code. (No empty div, no redundant css properties...) 

### CSS : 
 * try to use shared class as much as possible 
 * try to stay away from using `id`
 * Mobile First approach 
 
### Workflow: 
1. When working on a new feature, create a new branch.
2. When done with the feature, merge master into your branch just in case.
3. Push the branch to Github and create a Pull Request.
4. Send the pull request out to the team and ask for a review.
5. Once it is approved, the feature will be merged safely into master.
6. Then, the task can be moved to 'Done'.
