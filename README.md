# Project 1

### Always remember to : 
 * use clear indentation, spacing => for additional readability 
 * include comments to describe what the code does 
 * NO redundant code. (No empty div, no redundant css properties...) 

### CSS : 
 * try to use shared class as much as possible 
 * try to stay away from using `id`
 * Mobile First approach 
 
### Workflow: 
1. Before working on a new feature, always do a `git pull` on `master`. 
2. **THEN** create a new branch.
3. When done with the feature, merge master into your branch just in case.
4. Push the branch to Github and create a Pull Request.
5. Send the pull request out to the team and ask for a review.
6. Once it is approved, the feature will be merged safely into master.
7. Then, the task can be moved to 'Done'.
